Hey there {name} —

Thanks for signing up for my newsletter! I write about Ruby, and Rails, and code quality, and object-oriented design, and the social factors of programming. Mostly I want to give you ideas that will help you at your job.

To that end, why don't you hit "reply" and tell me one thing that's really bugged you at work recently.

It could be a corner of a codebase that you feel is being neglected. It could be one ugly technique that is consistently causing bugs. It could be a library you use regularly, but haven't fully figured out yet. Maybe you feel you know a better way to do something, but you can't convince the rest of your team.

Please, hit "reply" and write me a little bit about the first issue that comes to mind. If you have the time, I'd also love it if you include a little bit about yourself. Who are you? Where are you in your career? What professional goals do you have for the next year?

You don't have to write a novel, just short note, and I'll try to reply to every email. Thanks for your time, thanks for joining, and have an awesome day!
